# Time2Meet
Time2Meet is a meeting planning app in which users can host a meeting and get participants to pick their free time, then based on a visual chart created by everyone’s free time, the host can set an official time to meet.

This app is inspired by When2Meet and Google Calendar. As users, we found that When2Meet is a convenient meeting hosting website. However, its interface makes users lose interest easily due to the oversimplicity, unattractiveness, and sometimes counter-intuitive design elements. About Google Calendar, it is a wonderful calendar to manage individuals’ schedules, as well as hosting events. However, because of its professionalism, the adjustment of each meeting can affect other ones or other participants’ schedules unintentionally if the host is not familiar with the app. With all of that said, we try to create an app that meets both criteria: interesting user interface and friendly to basic users.

# Target Users
We are aiming this app at groups of students, co-workers and friends, who may want a quick way to host all kinds of events: from basic gatherings with friends to professional meetings in a business environment, and to have a convenient way to decide on an agreed hour to meet.

# Environment
Devices running Android 7 and above (API level 24 and above)

# Key Features
## Meeting Functions
To follow up the convenience spirit of When2Meet, users aren’t required to have an account to use our meeting features. If they don’t have one, they can quickly create a temporary account for use only in that meeting. However, without an account, users cannot conveniently manage their attended meetings by the account features, which we will show in detail in the ‘Account Functions’ section.

- Pick individual free time: This feature is inspired by When2Meet, where we create a board for each attendee of a meeting to set their free time on. Based on the mutually available time compiled from all these individual boards, the host can decide on which time to meet to maximize attendees’ participation.
- Auto-fill individual board based on account meeting timetable (minor feature)
- Map functions (minor feature):
	- Show distance, direction, moving time, pinned locations
	- Notify based on estimated moving time, approximated under current traffic conditions

And other basic features:
